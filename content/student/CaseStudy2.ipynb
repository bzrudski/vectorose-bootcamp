    "\n",
    "But what if we want to get some numerical insights?\n",

    "\n",
    "VectoRose can compute the correlation between the orientation and magnitude data. If the two variables are statistically independent, they will not be correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the correlation using the function [`vr.stats.compute_magnitude_orientation_correlation`](https://vectorose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/vectorose/stats/index.html#vectorose.stats.compute_magnitude_orientation_correlation).\n",

    "* Using VectoRose, we can examine vectors that have **different magnitudes**.\n",
    "* We can construct **magnitude histograms** showing the distribution of vector lengths.\n",
    "* We can construct **bivariate histograms** showing the interplay of magnitude and orientation. We can produce **animations** showing the different histogram shells.\n",
    "* We can construct **conditional orientation and magnitude histograms** which show the distribution of one variable while filtering based on the other one.\n",
    "* We can **compute statistics** on the magnitudes and filtered data and compute the **correlation** between magnitude and orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we've covered the fundamentals of using VectoRose. You should be able to apply VectoRose to studying different collections of vectors, regardless of whether they are of unit or non-unit length."
