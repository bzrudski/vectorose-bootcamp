    "In the previous case study notebook, we saw how to use VectoRose for analysing pure orientations. We constructed spherical orientation histograms and filtered based on orientation.\n",

    "Now, we're going to kick things up a notch.\n",

    "Bones are not fully-filled structures. Inside bone, there is a network of dense, interconnected struts, known as *trabeculae*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll focus on the trabecular bone in the femur of a mature sheep. Trabecular bone isn't found throughout the entire bone. Instead, in long bones, like the femur, it's found at the two ends, or *epiphyses*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the worked example, we'll analyse the trabecular bone in the *proximal* epiphysis, the end that is closest to the hip. Later, you'll be able to analyse the trabecular bone in the *distal* epiphysis, which is part of the knee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire sheep femur is a very, very big dataset. Instead of looking at the entire volume here, we'll look at two different meshes for a start. We'll look at the exterior shell of the femur, just to get a feel for the bone, and then, we'll look at some simplified cubes of trabecular bone to understand this structure a bit better."

    "Up until now, all our analysis have been visual. We've been looking at the magnitude distribution, the bivariate distribution, and the conditional distributions...\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to get some numerical insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the magnitude data are scalars, so we can just analyse both the marginal and conditional magnitude distributions using standard statistics (if the context allows for it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can just analyse conditional orientation distributions with directional statistics approaches. We saw some of these approaches that are implemented in VectoRose in the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the bivariate distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "VectoRose can compute the correlation between the orientation and magnitude data. If the two variables are statistically independent, they will not be correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the correlation using the function [`vr.stats.compute_magnitude_orientation_correlation`](https://vectorose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/vectorose/stats/index.html#vectorose.stats.compute_magnitude_orientation_correlation).\n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns both the correlation coefficient and the result of the hypothesis test (containing the *p*-value).\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we need an array containing our vectors. Unlike previously, these vectors **should not be unit vectors** (otherwise, there won't be any correlation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We could do this once again with the method [`convert_vectors_to_cartesian_array`](https://vectorose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/vectorose/sphere_base/index.html#vectorose.sphere_base.SphereBase.convert_vectors_to_cartesian_array) of the `FineTregenzaSphere`, but we don't have to since we have our **unduplicated** vectors already stored in an array."

    "We've now reached the end of this notebook on using VectoRose to analyse trabecular anisotropy. Here's a recap of what we saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using VectoRose, we can examine vectors that have **different magnitudes**.\n",
    "* We can construct **magnitude histograms** showing the distribution of vector lengths.\n",
    "* We can construct **bivariate histograms** showing the interplay of magnitude and orientation. We can produce **animations** showing the different histogram shells.\n",
    "* We can construct **conditional orientation and magnitude histograms** which show the distribution of one variable while filtering based on the other one.\n",
    "* We can **compute statistics** on the magnitudes and filtered data and compute the **correlation** between magnitude and orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we've covered the fundamentals of using VectoRose. You should be able to apply VectoRose to studying different collections of vectors, regardless of whether they are of unit or non-unit length."

    "In this notebook, we've been exploring the proximal epiphysis of the mature sheep femur. What about the other end of the bone? I've provided the anisotropy field for the distal epiphysis in the file [`../assets/CaseStudy2/MatureSheepFemur_Distal_S750_R1500_SMOOTH1_EIG_MASKED.npy`](../assets/CaseStudy2/MatureSheepFemur_Distal_S750_R1500_SMOOTH1_EIG_MASKED.npy). Look at it in terms of the magnitude and bivariate distributions, and then explore any interesting features using conditional plots. Does the distal end look different from the proximal end of this bone?"
