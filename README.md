# Analysing Directional Data using VectoRose

CRBS McGill Bootcamp

August 2025

## Motivation & Summary

Many scientific fields rely on oriented and directed data,
represented as vectors. While these vectors can be visualised in 3D maps, 
downstream analyses are more complicated.
This workshop will focus on basic concepts for analysing vectorial data
using [VectoRose](https://vectorose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
a new open-source Python package.

## Prerequisites

Attendees should have basic knowledge of programming in Python.
A local Python installation is strongly encouraged;
Google Colab may be used instead but not all VectoRose features are supported.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants will:
1. Understand the basics of directed and oriented data.
2. Be able to construct orientation histograms using VectoRose.
3. Be able to compute directional statistics using VectoRose.
